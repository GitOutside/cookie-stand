  <p id="intro">Pat Smith spent a long winter snowed in at a remote location in NW Alaska. The only reliable food source was a large cache of dried salmon left over from a mining expedition gone bad.<br/>With a lot of salmon, a little ingenuity and a what-the-hell attitude, Pat's Salmon Cookies were born.<br/>We invite you to share in this unique culinary experience. C'mon on in, the salmon's fine</p>
